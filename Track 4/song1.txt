There was a time
I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home
I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone
Now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs
From the places where I was born
Up on a hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
There was a time
I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world
I thought I'd never lose her out of sight
We were so young
I think of her now and then
I still here the songs
Reminding me of a friend
Up on a hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
See Heaven's got a plan for you
See Heaven's got a plan for you
See Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Yeah
