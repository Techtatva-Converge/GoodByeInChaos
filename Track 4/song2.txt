I was busy thinkin′ 'bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreamin′ 'bout boys
Boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin′ ′bout boys

I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all
I want ′em all
And when they finally leave me I'm all alone, but
I′m lookin' down and my girls are blowin′ my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn′t hit ′em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
"I had to trash the hotel lobby"

But I was busy thinkin′ 'bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreamin′ 'bout boys
Boys, boys
Head is spinnin′ thinkin' 'bout boys

In every city I got one with different ringtones
Flyin′ from LA all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are calling me asking me where I′m at
Didn't hit ′em back
pre-chorus
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse, like
But I can′t even lie, you got me
chorus
I was busy thinkin' ′bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys
Boys, boys
Head is spinnin′ thinkin′ 'bout boys

Don′t be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can′t stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don′t be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Missed what you was sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don′t be mad, not like I had a choice

I was busy thinkin′ 'bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreamin′ 'bout boys
Boys, boys

I was busy thinkin′ 'bout boys (Boys)
Boys (Boys), boys
I was busy dreamin′ 'bout boys (Boys)
Boys (Oh, baby), boys (Yeah)
Head is spinnin' thinkin′ ′bout boys
