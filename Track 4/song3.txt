Waking up back home in New York City
And I know I miss you, and I hope you miss me too, yeah
The days away leave me feeling so empty
But I can't wait 'til I can take you with me, ooh yeah
Say, you're gonna stay with me
Don't you let me go, no
You're the kinda love for me
You already know
Come back home late
And fall right into your bed (Oh, oh, oh)
Every time I feel it over again
You're throwing fuel into my fire
Racing, making me bleed
Do you still feel it in your chest
The way you did at sixteen?
Didn't know I was alive
Until you made my heart beat
Thought my youth was going quickly
But you give me sixteen
I'm tryna find my way through LAX
And I'm so lost, don't know what to expect to ya
Growing up means growing tired, I guess, yeah
But nothing gets me when I'm right here next to you, yeah
Say, you're gonna stay with me
Don't you let me go, no
You're the kinda love for me
You already know
Come back home late
And fall right into your bed (Oh, oh, oh)
Every time I feel it over again
You're throwing fuel into my fire
Racing, making me bleed
Do you still feel it in your chest
The way you did at sixteen?
Didn't know I was alive
Until you made my heart beat
Thought my youth was going quickly
But you give me sixteen
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
I thought my youth was going quickly (Do you still feel it?)
But you give me sixteen
You're throwing fuel into my fire
Racing, making me bleed
Do you still feel it in your chest
The way you did at sixteen?
Didn't know I was alive
Until you made my heart beat
I thought my youth was going quickly
But you give me sixteen
