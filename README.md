# The False Farewell

> *"Some songs are not sung to be heard — but to be found."*

---

Long ago, a quiet rebellion took place — its songs buried in the noise of time.  
Four choirs sang, each in their own chamber, their verses etched into text and silence.  
In the harmony, one note slipped — a misplaced echo that set the wheel of chaos in motion.  

The archives were rewritten hundreds of times, each commit a step deeper into history.  
Yet within three forgotten revisions lie the scattered echoes of a flag — encrypted by a cipher known only to those who listen between the letters.

**Follow the rhythm.**  
**The wrong goodbye whispers truth.**  
**Chaos guards its echo.**
